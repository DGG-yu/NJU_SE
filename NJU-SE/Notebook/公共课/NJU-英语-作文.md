This graph shows the growth of the population in Canada from 1978 to 2009. It is taken from the website about [Statistics in Canada](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/12-581-x/2010000/pop-eng.htm#c03).

There are three graphs in the chart. The green graph shows the total growth of the population, the black one **deals with** the migrated people in Canada and the blue graph shows the natural increase of the population. In 1988/89 **there was an enourmous growth**. In the following years the total growth **went down to about** 250,000 in 1998/99. From that time on the Canadian population has been gradually growing again although the natural increase slows down. **So we can say** that the growth of the population in Canada is based on migration.

And here is an excellent example of writing about bar graphs prepared by the [British Council](https://learnenglishteens.britishcouncil.org/skills/writing/upper-intermediate-b2-writing/writing-about-bar-chart) as an answer to this exam question. You can also use the following vocabulary to talk about bar charts used in your presentation:

![bar chart illustrates](https://preply.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed.jpg)

### **How to describe line graphs**

Now, when you know how to describe bar charts, what about line graphs? This type of charts converts information into points on a grid that is connected with a line to represent trends, changes, or relationship between objects, numbers, dates, etc. These lines show movement over time affected by the increase or decrease in the key factors.

To express the movement of the line, you should use appropriate *verbs, adjectives, and adverbs*depending on the kind of action you need to show. For this, you should use the following vocabulary:

**Verbs**: rise, increase, grow, go up to, climb, boom, peak, fall, decline, decrease, drop, dip, go down, reduce, level up, remain stable, no change, remain steady, stay constant, stay, maintain the same level, crash, collapse, plunge, plummet.*fluctuated*

**Adjectives**: sharp, rapid, huge, dramatic, substantial, considerable, significant, slight, small, minimal, massive.

**Adverbs**: dramatically, rapidly, hugely, massive, sharply, steeply, considerably, substantially, significantly, slightly, minimally, markedly.

There is also a list of **adverbs** to describe the *speed of a change:* rapidly, quickly, swiftly, suddenly, steadily, gradually, slowly.

![exam questions IELTS](https://preply.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-1.jpg)

The appropriate vocabulary below will help you understand how to describe such charts:

### **How to describe pie charts**

The pie chart is primarily used to illustrate how different parts make up a whole. The best way to present your data in a pie chart is to compare the categories with each other. The following comparison words can be used interchangeably:

- to compare
- compared to
- as opposed to
- versus
- more than
- the majority of
- only a small monitory
- greater than
- less than

Here we have an example of a pie chart that represents how internet users aged 16+ prefer to browse the web:

This example demonstrates the best way to summarize data by selecting and reporting the main features:
