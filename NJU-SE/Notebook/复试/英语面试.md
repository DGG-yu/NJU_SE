  Good afternoon, professors. I am really glad to be here for this interview. Now, please allow me to give a brief self-introduction.
   
  My name is Shui Guangshan, 22 years old. I was born in Fuyang, a beautiful city in Anhui province. It was when I entered the Central South University 4 years ago that I officially became a student majoring in Public Administration. Through a competition, I learned about operational research and Management Science and Engineering. Gradually, I found myself obsessed with the charm of this major and in order to develop a comprehensive view of this major, I choose to go further with my study to achieve a master’s degree. 
   
  During the four years in this beautiful college, I have been studying very hard and was granted scholarship several times. In addition, I participated in some competitions actively such as Mathematical model competition, innovation and entrepreneurship competition and so on.
   
  In my spare time, I enjoy taking part in some activities. Moreover, Chinese chess and running are my passions, which enrich my campus life very much, and also benefit me in many ways, like keeping fit, making lots of friends as well as developing my logic intelligence.
   
  Last but not least, I am a dedicated student and a people person, therefore, I have established good relationship with my classmates. As is well-known, Central South University is an outstanding college with perfect academic atmosphere and highly qualified faculty. And I would appreciate it if you could give me the chance for further study!
   
  That’s all. Thanks for your attention!

  and you are welcome to visit here
  ```

  

* Course?

  ```
  Software Engineeing
  
  Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software. Software engineering is a direct sub-field of engineering and has an overlap with computer science and management science. It is also considered a part of overall systems engineering.
  
  
  ```

  

* What course do you major?

  ```
  Big Data
  Big data was originally associated with four key concepts: volume, variety,velocity and value.
  
  Current usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics, user behavior analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from data, and seldom to a particular size of data set.
  
  ```

  

* college life?

  ```
  well,My college life is quite rich.
  At first my major was engineering mechanics, but later I switched to software engineering because of my interest.
  After that transition, it took me a long time to follow up the learning process.
  Since the second semester of my sophomore year, I started to teach myself some interesting technologies and chose the direction of big data.
  And I completed some interesting projects with the techniques I learned.
  I continued to study and practice until the second semester of junior year
  Start preparing for the postgraduate entrance examination
  
  In addition, I also actively participate in volunteer activities
  I used to raise funds for children in remote areas
  I used to be a voluntary tutor in the community
  ```

  

* HTML5? advantage of use it

  ```
  HTML5 is a software solution stack that defines the properties and behaviors of web page content by implementing a markup-based pattern to it.
  
  upgrated HTML
  
  * Improved Accessibility – One of the advantages of HTML5 is that it has improved the accessibility of websites. This new improvement offers improved access to the users irrespective of the screen size, orientation and resolution of the device.
  
  * Cleaner Code - it allows you to write descriptive and semantic code cleanly.
  
  * Cross Browser Compatible -  It supports all major browsers in the world including Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera and Safari and even supports their legacy versions
  
  * Audio/Video Support – Using audio and video elements in the past meant using the Flash Player or other third party media players which made these elements accessible to only a few who had these players installed.
  ```

  

* Why do people divide into three layers?(MVC)

  ```
  MVC is an application design model comprised of three interconnected parts. They include the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (processes that handle input).
  
  * MVC architecture helps us to control the complexity of application by dividing it into three components i.e. model, view and controller.
  
  * MVC does not use server-based forms, that’s why it is ideal for those developers who want full control over their application behavior.
  
  * Test driven development approach is supported by MVC architecture.
  
  * MVC architecture provide the concept of parallel development as it divides the logic of application into three layers, so each different developer can work simultaneously on these three layers of the same web application.
  ```

* How do you think software?

  ```
  software is a collection of programs and documents. 
  Software is the result of the efforts of engineers. Like other products, it can be very good or bad. It also needs to meet complex quality requirements.
  The software is used in various fields of the world and has a profound impact on people's lives and work.
  
  
  Software does not necessarily include only computer programs that can run on a computer. In some definitions, documents related to computer programs are generally considered to be part of the software. Simply put, 
  
  Before I switched into software engineering
  I think software is magic, everything is amazing
  When I really learned to develop a software
  I think software is a child of programmers
  ```

* Why do you learn SE and why do we need SE？

  ```
  Well, Software Engineering is literally important for the development of software
  if i just want to build a demo , this is ok without software engineering
  but if i need to build a project , or work with teammates , It becomes very necessary.
  
  Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software. Software engineering is a direct sub-field of engineering and has an overlap with computer science and management science. It is also considered a part of overall systems engineering.
  
  Anyway,It makes development more efficient,and makes projects more adaptable to change
  ```

* 为什么考研

  ```
  well , it's complicate 
  first , Nanjing University is my dreaming university.I miss it when i took the college entrance examination.
  secondly , I don't think what i have learned is enough for my career. I wanna to gain more in-depth knowledge.
  ```

* 研究生规划

  ```
  well , If I am fortunate to be admitted ,  maybe my Graduate career will start from this summer.
  I wanna to use this time to consolidate basic knowledge and learn English.
  In the first year , I will study hard with my seniors and decide whether to pursue a PhD
  and in the second year , 
  Work hard to help teachers complete scientific research and publish some valuable papers
  I am gonna do projects seriously and strive for scientific research results
  ```

* What is your biggest weakness

  ```
  when I cooperate with other teamates, I am a little too aggressive, so when the progress of other team members is delayed, I will go to urge them directly, but what I learned recently is to be more considerate of others, if I can know the reason for their delay, I can Help them.
  
  my lifestyle is irregular
  
  I was too passionate that I often stayed up late to write code, which led to poor energy in the next day.
and I am trying to improve this unhealthy working habit
  ```
  
* strength

  ```
  I am a fast learner and I am passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to practice
  ```

  

* why NJU ?

  ```
  As is well-known, Nanjing University is an outstanding college with perfect academic atmosphere and highly qualified faculty. And I would appreciate it if you could give me the chance for further study!
  ```

先说英语面试，今年英语面试形式多样，有阅读期刊回答问题，有抽纸条回答问题，有直接提问，一般没有问你为什么考研这类无关紧要的问题，问题大多和专业相关。抽纸条的有，软件工程对现代生活的影响？你作为软件工程师，你可以做什么？你对接下来两年的研究生生活有什么规划？你对哪个研究方向感兴趣？然后接着你说的方向展开提问。问题很灵活，英语口语好的较占优势。

擀擀单单。前面人被问得蛮惨的，问了什么大数据云计算，我在门外一顿狂搜，结果进去自我介绍都没让介绍（我可是背了一个多小时）



我的心得：抓住机会，一顿狂说，很喜欢，来过很多次，很多亲戚在这边，离我家很近，我也是江苏人，我觉得南京是新信息科技产业和古老的中华传统风格相互融合的一个奇妙结合体，有历史的厚重也有新科技新技术的活力等等说了好久。

老师很满意，其实英语 关键在于 抓住回话的主导权，和老师聊天一样去聊。

接着问 我家离南京多远，微信给人生活带来的变化。



听说 另外一个组的可能难点，老师会问点相关的问题，比如自我介绍、为什么考研、选择南京? 出生地等等简单问题。最重要的就是不要怕，准备好就可以了。不能不说。
